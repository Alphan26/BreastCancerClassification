<h1>Breast Cancer Clasification Using Multimodal Approach</h1>

This project focuses on the detection of breast cancer, which is common among women, using image processing techniques. The aim of this study is to assist radiologists in making more confident decisions while also speeding up their decision-making process. The project utilizes PyTorch and leverages the CBIS-DDSM dataset. To enhance the AI's ability to detect cancerous cells during the training phase, certain textual data present in the dataset were also incorporated using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). Thus, the overall model follows a multimodal approach. With this study, we aim to reduce the high false positive rate, a common issue in breast cancer detection, and demonstrate that including patients' textual data can improve the model's accuracy.
